# Software Engineering - Git Activity

## Overview
This repository is part of a hands-on activity to understand and practice the basics of version control using Git and GitHub. The activity aims to help us gain collaborative coding experience by working on tasks like adding files, making changes, and resolving conflicts.

## Objectives
- Learn how to use Git for version control.
- Understand the basic Git commands: `clone`, `add`, `commit`, `push`, etc.
- Practice branching and resolving merge conflicts.
- Collaborate on a shared GitHub repository.

  git checkout <branch-name>
  ```
- Merge branches:
  ```bash
  git merge <branch-name>
  ```

## Learning Outcome
